# German BERT

## Stats

In addition to the recently released [German BERT](https://deepset.ai/german-bert)
model by [deepset](https://deepset.ai/) we provide another German-language model.

The source data for the model consists of a recent Wikipedia dump, EU Bookshop corpus,
Open Subtitles, CommonCrawl, ParaCrawl and News Crawl. This results in a dataset with
a size of 16GB and 2,350,234,427 tokens.

For sentence splitting, we use [spacy](https://spacy.io/). Our preprocessing steps
(sentence piece model for vocab generation) follow those used for training
[SciBERT](https://github.com/allenai/scibert). The model is trained with an initial
sequence length of 512 subwords and was performed for 1.5M steps.

This release includes both cased and uncased models.

## Model weights

Currently only PyTorch-[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
compatible weights are available. If you need access to TensorFlow checkpoints,
please raise an issue!

## Usage

With Transformers >= 2.3 our German BERT models can be loaded like:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased")
```

# Italian BERT

The source data for the Italian BERT model consists of a recent Wikipedia dump and
various texts from the [OPUS corpora](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) collection. The final
training corpus has a size of 13GB and 2,050,057,573 tokens.

For sentence splitting, we use NLTK (faster compared to spacy).
Our cased and uncased models are training with an initial sequence length of 512
subwords for ~2-3M steps.

For the XXL Italian models, we use the same training data from OPUS and extend
it with data from the Italian part of the [OSCAR corpus](https://traces1.inria.fr/oscar/).
Thus, the final training corpus has a size of 81GB and 13,138,379,147 tokens.

Note: Unfortunately, a wrong vocab size was used when training the XXL models.
This explains the mismatch of the "real" vocab size of 31102, compared to the
vocab size specified in `config.json`. However, the model is working and all
evaluations were done under those circumstances.
See [this issue](https://github.com/dbmdz/berts/issues/7) for more information.

from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-italian-xxl-cased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-italian-xxl-cased")

# German Europeana BERT

We use the open source [Europeana newspapers](http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/)
that were provided by *The European Library*. The final
training corpus has a size of 51GB and consists of 8,035,986,369 tokens.

# Turkish BERT: BERTurk, DistilBERTurk and ELECTRA

BERTurk are community-driven cased models for Turkish.

Some datasets used for pretraining and evaluation are contributed from the
awesome Turkish NLP community, as well as the decision for the BERT model name: BERTurk.

The final training corpus has a size of 35GB and 44,04,976,662 tokens.

Detailed information about the data and pretraining steps can be found in
[this repository](https://github.com/stefan-it/turkish-bert).

Additionally, we trained a distilled version of BERTurk: *DistilBERTurk*, that
uses knowledge-distillation from BERTurk (teacher model). More information on
distillation can be found in the excellent ["DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)
paper by Sanh et al. (2019).

Furthermore, we provide cased and uncased models trained with a larger vocab size (128k instead of 32k).

We also trained small and base ELECTRA models. ELECTRA is a new method for self-supervised language
representation learning. More details about ELECTRA can be found in the
[ICLR paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xMH1BtvB).

Evaluation of our ELECTRA models can be found in
[this repository](https://github.com/stefan-it/turkish-bert/electra).
