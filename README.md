# German BERT

## Stats

In addition to the recently released [German BERT](https://deepset.ai/german-bert)
model by [deepset](https://deepset.ai/) we provide another German-language model.

The source data for the model consists of a recent Wikipedia dump, EU Bookshop corpus,
Open Subtitles, CommonCrawl, ParaCrawl and News Crawl. This results in a dataset with
a size of 16GB and 2,350,234,427 tokens.

For sentence splitting, we use [spacy](https://spacy.io/). Our preprocessing steps
(sentence piece model for vocab generation) follow those used for training
[SciBERT](https://github.com/allenai/scibert). The model is trained with an initial
sequence length of 512 subwords and was performed for 1.5M steps.

This release includes both cased and uncased models.

## Model weights

Currently only PyTorch-[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
compatible weights are available. If you need access to TensorFlow checkpoints,
please raise an issue!

## Usage

With Transformers >= 2.3 our German BERT models can be loaded like:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased")
```

# Italian BERT

The source data for the Italian BERT model consists of a recent Wikipedia dump and
various texts from the [OPUS corpora](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) collection. The final
training corpus has a size of 13GB and 2,050,057,573 tokens.

For sentence splitting, we train an own sentence splitting model using NLTK.
Our cased and uncased models are training with an initial sequence length of 512
subwords for ~2-3M steps.

## Model weights

Currently only PyTorch-[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
compatible weights are available. If you need access to TensorFlow checkpoints,
please raise an issue!
